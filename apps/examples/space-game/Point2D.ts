/**
 * A 2D point class that represents a point in a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system.
 *
 * The Point2D class provides immutable 2D point operations and calculations commonly used in
 * computer graphics, game development, physics simulations, and geometric computations.
 * Each instance represents a specific location or vector in 2D space defined by x and y coordinates.
 *
 * Key characteristics:
 * - üõ°Ô∏è **Worker-Safe**: All operations return new instances, ensuring thread safety in multi-threaded environments
 * - üîÑ **Structured Clone Compatible**: Safe for Web Worker communication via postMessage/JSON
 * - üîí **Immutable**: Once created, coordinate values cannot be modified
 * - üßÆ **Mathematical Operations**: Supports vector arithmetic, distance calculations, and geometric transformations
 * - üìè **Multiple Distance Metrics**: Euclidean, Manhattan, and Chebyshev distance calculations
 * - ‚ö° **Vector Operations**: Dot product, magnitude, normalization, and scaling
 * - üõ†Ô∏è **Utility Methods**: String representation and coordinate extraction
 *
 * Thread Safety Guarantees:
 * - All methods return new Point2D instances, never `this`
 * - No shared state between instances
 * - Safe for use in Web Workers and multi-threaded environments
 * - Compatible with structured clone algorithm (postMessage, JSON serialization)
 *
 * Common use cases:
 * - Representing positions of game objects in 2D space
 * - Calculating distances between objects or points
 * - Performing vector-based movement and physics calculations
 * - Geometric computations in graphics and animation systems
 * - Pathfinding algorithms and spatial reasoning
 * - Safe communication between Web Workers via postMessage
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Create points
 * const origin = Point2D.ZERO;
 * const point = new Point2D(3, 4);
 *
 * // Vector operations (all return new instances)
 * const moved = point.add(new Point2D(1, 2));      // Point2D instance
 * const movedFromObject = point.add({ x: 1, y: 2 }); // PointLike object - now supported!
 * const scaled = point.scale(2);
 *
 * // Distance calculations
 * const distance = point.euclideanDistance(origin);        // Point2D instance
 * const distanceFromObject = point.euclideanDistance({ x: 0, y: 0 }); // PointLike object - now supported!
 * const manhattan = point.manhattanDistance(origin);
 *
 * // Vector properties
 * const length = point.magnitude();
 * const unitVector = point.normalize();
 *
 * // Floating-point equality with epsilon tolerance
 * const point1 = new Point2D(1.0000001, 2.0000001);
 * const point2 = new Point2D(1, 2);
 * console.log(point1.equals(point2));        // false (strict equality)
 * console.log(point1.equals(point2, 0.001)); // true (with epsilon tolerance)

 * // Worker-safe serialization
 * const worker = new Worker('worker.js');
 * worker.postMessage(point.toJSON());
 * // In worker:
 * const revived = Point2D.revive(event.data);

/**
 * A high-performance utility for zero-copy sharing of 2D points between threads
 * using SharedArrayBuffer. This class provides mutable access to point coordinates
 * with atomic operations for thread safety.
 *
 * Key characteristics:
 * - Zero-copy sharing: Points are stored in typed arrays for efficient transfer
 * - Atomic operations: Thread-safe coordinate access using Atomics
 * - Mutable design: Coordinates can be modified directly (unlike Point2D)
 * - Factory pattern: Easy creation of different buffer types
 *
 * Thread Safety Considerations:
 * - This class is mutable by design
 * - Multiple threads can modify the same buffer coordinates
 * - Atomic operations ensure individual coordinate access is thread-safe
 * - Complex operations require external synchronization
 *
 * Performance Benefits:
 * - No garbage collection overhead
 * - Direct memory access
 * - Efficient transfer between threads via postMessage
 * - Batch operations for multiple points
 *
 * Common use cases:
 * - Physics simulations in Web Workers
 * - Real-time graphics rendering
 * - High-performance game engines
 * - Data processing pipelines
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Create a shared buffer for 1000 points
 * const buffer = PointBuffer.shared(1000);
 *
 * // Set a point's coordinates
 * buffer.index = 42;
 * buffer.x = 10.5;
 * buffer.y = 20.3;
 *
 * // Atomic access in multi-threaded environments
 * const x = buffer.atomicGetX();
 * const y = buffer.atomicGetY();
 *
 * // Convert to immutable Point2D
 * const point = buffer.toPoint2D();
 *
 * // Batch operations
