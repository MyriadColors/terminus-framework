# Apps Directory

This directory is where you should place your custom applications and commands when using Terminus Framework.

## Structure

- `examples/` - Example applications and commands (like the calculator)
- `[your-app-name]/` - Create your own directories for your applications

## How to Use

1. Create a new directory for your application (e.g., `my-app/`)
2. Add your custom commands in that directory
3. Import and register your commands in your `App.tsx` file

## Examples

The `examples/` directory contains example applications that demonstrate how to use Terminus Framework:

- `calculator.tsx` - A simple calculator application with add, subtract, multiply, and divide commands

To use an example in your application, you can copy it to your own app directory and import it in your `App.tsx`.
